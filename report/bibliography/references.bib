  abstract = {Adaptive Planning is an approach to planning in the commonsense domain. An adaptive planner takes advantage of the habitual nature of many of the planning situations for which it plans by bosing its activities on a memory of pre-stored plans. A critical issue, and the subject of this paper, is the question of flexibility: How does an adaptive planner refit an old plan in order to meet the demands of some new planning situation? An adaptive planner refits prestored plans by constructing an interpretation of the situation in which it is engaged. Key elements in the theory of adaptive planning are its treatment of specific plans and a notion of situation matching. The theory of adaptive planning has been modeled by a computer program called PLEXUS.},

  abstract = {Overcooked, an immersive multiplayer video game centered around cooperative cooking challenges, provides the roots for this research project. The study focuses on designing and evaluating a hand-authored controller in comparison to controllers implemented using various machine learning techniques, such as Population Based Training, in the context of a simplified version of the game. The main objective is to assess the cooperation between the hand-authored controller and a human controlled agent, with a particular emphasis on the coordination and minimizing errors during runs of fixed time length. A testing method has been designed in order to more accurately evaluate the performance. Through the implementation of a specialized controller utilizing techniques such as Behavior Trees and Decision Trees, the controller was able to successfully accomplish the task of delivering soups. An analysis was made to examine the performance of the hand-authored controller in comparison to the results obtained in other research papers that use the same simplified version of the game. After the results have been obtained, a clear difference was visible. The scripted AI performed better when paired with himself than one created with population based training that was paired with himself. However, the scripted AI was not better than a coupled planning algorithm that was paired with himself, but the computations were easier and faster for the scripted AI. When paired with a human, the overall performance decreases, but increases only for one specific map.},

In many real-world scenarios the problem is partially known, imprecise and dynamic such that some effects of actions are undesired and/or several unforeseen incidences or changes can occur. Whereas expressivity, efficiency, and optimality have been the typical goals in the area, there are several issues regarding robustness that have a clear relevance in dynamic Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). However, there is still no clear and common definition of robustness-related concepts in CSPs. In this paper, we propose two clearly differentiated definitions for robustness and stability in CSP solutions. We also introduce the concepts of recoverability and reliability, which arise in temporal CSPs. All these definitions are based on related well-known concepts, which are addressed in engineering and other related areas.},

Despite those important progresses, robotic systems still tend to have a reactive architecture with very little deliberation on the course of the plan they might follow. In this thesis, we argue that a successful integration with a robotic system requires the planner to have capacities for both temporal and hierarchical reasoning. The former is indeed a universal resource central in many robot activities while the latter is a critical component for the integration of reasoning capabilities at different abstraction levels, typically starting with a high level view of an activity that is iteratively refined down to motion primitives.},

Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.

In response to these inconveniences, we propose in this paper a new general POCL (Partial Order Causal Link) approach to represent and solve a temporal HTN problem by using existing heuristics developed to solve non temporal problems. We show experimentally that this approach is performant and can outperform the existing ones.},

ANML is a recent proposal motivated by combining the expressiveness of the timeline representation with decomposition methods of Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN). Our current focus is not efficient temporal planning per se, but the tight integration of acting and planning. This integration is addressed by: (i) extending HTN methods with the refinement of planned actions with skills, expressed in PRS, to map actions into low-level commands, (ii) interleaving the planning process with acting, the former performs plan repair and replanning, while the latter implements the skill-based refinements, and (iii) executing commands with a dispatching mechanism that synchronizes observed time points of action effects and events with planned time. FAPE has been integrated to a PR2 robot and experimented in a home-like environment. The paper presents how planning is performed and integrated with acting and describes briefly the robotics experiments.},

  abstract = {For automated planning robot behaviour in a rather unexplored world, often there are exogenous events introducing new objects triggered by the actions that were unforeseen in the initial state of the planning domain model. This suggests extending PDDL, on every of its language levels, by a feature for dynamic object creation. Syntactically, this is dealt with by adding a keyword new to PDDL. Semantically, the core challenge in dealing with dynamically created objects is that they lead to a growing state representation during the plan space exploration. As almost all existing automated planners are not designed to deal with varying state vectors ---mainly due to relying on grounding of the lifted PDDL input in their static analysis stage--- in this short paper we present a first solution to solve the dynamic object creation problem via a translation of PDDL model into a term rewriting tool, where plans can be found.},

  abstract = {Hierarchies are one of the most common structures used to understand and conceptualise the world. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning, which deals with the automation of world-relevant problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is the branch that represents and handles hierarchies. In particular, the requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to be very useful, and also to perform well. However, the history of almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these issues, the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with the requirements of real-world applications has been often questioned. As a remedy, we propose a framework-based approach where we first provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set of concepts that helps in interpreting HTN planners from the aspect of their search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness, competence, computation and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service composition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service composition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for future work. In summary, we provide a novel and comprehensive viewpoint on a core AI planning technique.},

  abstract = {Hierarchies are the most common structure used to understand the world better. In galaxies, for instance, multiple-star systems are organised in a hierarchical system. Then, governmental and company organisations are structured using a hierarchy, while the Internet, which is used on a daily basis, has a space of domain names arranged hierarchically. Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to solve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has been introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these issues, attention attracts the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with the requirements of applications from the real world. We propose a framework-based approach to remedy this situation. First, we provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set of concepts that helps to interpret HTN planners from the aspect of their search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness, competence, performance and applicability.

Unlike many existing HTN plan repair approaches that depend on chronological backtracking, SHOPFIXER uses backjumping techniques to efficiently, correctly and stably repair the hierarchical plans, where stability means with minimal perturbation to the origi- nal plan. We describe our new plan repair method and present experimental results in a number of IPC domains, demon- strating that it generates plans with limited perturbations, and that its plan repair is more computationally efficient than re- planning. We compare our results with earlier experimental results from Fox, et al. on plan repair and plan stability. Our results confirm theirs, and generalize them. Specifically, we generalize their LPG-repair algorithm to handle plan upsets during execution, and evaluate it in such situations.},

One example of such an AI, made using planning algorithms, was studied in a paper from 2019 which used a simplified version of the video game Overcooked for evaluation. However, only limited evaluations were possible due to the long runtime and heuristic optimisations made. This paper will attempt to increase the amount of evaluations while removing an important optimisation limiting the functionality of the AI: the omission of counters. In the end it will find ways of reducing the runtime and increasing performance, which together allow for the addition of counters in a few instances. The final results with counters suggest there is more to gain upon removal of a select few heuristic optimisations and improvement of the human behavioural clone used to simulate a human.},

  author = {Hoffmann, Jorg and Brafman, Ronen I},
  abstract = {Contingent planning is the task of generating a conditional plan given uncertainty about the initial state and action effects, but with the ability to observe some aspects of the current world state. Contingent planning can be transformed into an And-Or search problem in belief space, the space whose elements are sets of possible worlds. In (Brafman \& Hoffmann 2004), we introduced a method for implicitly representing a belief state using a propositional formula that describes the sequence of actions leading to that state. This representation trades off space for time and was shown to be quite effective for conformant planning within a heuristic forwardsearch planner based on the FF system. In this paper we apply the same architecture to contingent planning. The changes required to adapt the search space representation are small. More effort is required to adapt the relaxed planning problems whose solution informs the forward search algorithm. We propose the targeted use of an additional relaxation, mapping the relaxed contingent problem into a relaxed conformant problem. Experimental results show that the resulting planning system, Contingent-FF, is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art contingent planners POND and MBP.},

Solvers are often based on heuristic search, but especially regarding domain-independent heuristics, techniques in classical planning are more sophisticated. However, due to the different problem classes, it is difficult to use them in hierarchical planning. In this paper we describe how to use arbitrary classical heuristics in hierarchical planning and show that the resulting system outperforms the state of the art in hierarchical planning.},

Many recent systems do not rely on hand-tailored advice anymore to find solutions, but are supposed to be domain-independent systems that come with sophisticated solving techniques. In principle, this development would make the comparison between systems easier (because the domains are not tailored to a single system anymore) and -- much more important -- also the integration into other systems, because the modeling process is less tedious (due to the lack of advice) and there is no (or less) commitment to a certain planning system the model is created for. However, these advantages are destroyed by the lack of a common input language and feature set supported by the different systems. In this paper, we propose an extension to PDDL, the description language used in non-hierarchical planning, to the needs of hierarchical planning systems.},

TAL is used as the formal semantic basis for TALplanner, where a TAL goal narrative with control formulas is input to TALplanner which then generates a TAL narrative that entails the goal and control formulas. The sequential version of TALplanner is presented. The expressivity of plan operators is then extended to deal with an interesting class of resource types. An algorithm for generating concurrent plans, where operators have varying durations and internal state, is also presented. All versions of TALplanner have been implemented. The potential of these techniques is demonstrated by applying TALplanner to a number of standard planning benchmarks in the literature.},

One way to reduce the complexity is to follow recipes that provide an ordered set of tasks for the preparation of a dish. This concept was already transferred to cooking assistants which present the recipe to the cook while adding further assistance like device control or step-by-step visualization. Although recipes and assistants simplify the cooking process itself, other factors like the available devices or differences in cooking skills are ignored. Aside from that, current assistants are often limited to one recipe at a time, ignoring the regularly occurring requirement to prepare a meal of multiple components. Considering these challenges, we propose our adaptive cooking assistant HanKA that considers the individual user skill and environmental kitchen setup, while assisting the cook at the preparation of their freely combined and synchronized recipes. This is achieved through a modular approach consisting of the automatic detection and control of the available devices and user interfaces, the scheduling of multiple recipes based on the distributed knowledge representation, and a deviation management that considers the user experience. Hereby, we created an adaptive cooking assistant that considers various influences that occur in a cooking scenario, resulting in a better assistance for the user.},

  abstract = {Arguably the main goal of artificial intelligence is to create agents that can collaborate with humans to achieve a shared goal. It has been shown that agents that assume their partner to be optimal can converge to protocols that humans do not understand. Taking human suboptimality into consideration is imperative to perform well in a coordination task. One way to achieve this is imitation learning, where you train an agent on recorded data from a human playing optimally. I created several agents using different implementations of behavioral cloning, by reducing the dataset to state-action pairs and training a neural network on this. To evaluate their performance, I used an environment that poses a coordination challenge based on the popular game Overcooked. Neither expanding nor reducing the feature space that the agents are trained on yielded any significant improvement in the performance of the agents. In fact, expanding the feature space to include some historical data made the agent less generalizable and especially failed to perform when paired with agents with unfamiliar strategies. These limitations were mostly posed by the available dataset, which was not big enough to support more features and of too low quality of gameplay to create agents that perform exceptionally well.},

As past research indicates that RL agents undergo a distributional shift when they start collaborating with human beings, the goal is to create agents that can adapt. We build upon research using the two-player Overcooked environment to repro- duce a simplified version of the Fictitious Co-Play algorithm in order to confirm past found improvements at a smaller scale of training and using Self-Play and Population- based trained algorithms as the baselines for comparison. We find that the agent on average slightly outperforms both baseline algorithms when evaluated using a human proxy. We also find high cross-seed variance in performance, indicating the potential for further hyperparameter tuning.},

Their resolution usually requires coordinated and concurrent action execution. In several cases, these problems are naturally decomposed in a hierarchical way and expressed by a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) formalism. HDDL, a hierarchical extension of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), unlike PDDL 2.1 does not allow to represent planning problems with numerical and temporal constraints, which are essential for real world applications. We propose to fill the gap between HDDL and these operational needs and to extend HDDL by taking inspiration from PDDL 2.1 in order to express numerical and temporal expressions. This paper opens discussions on the semantics and the syntax needed for a future HDDL 2.1 extension.},

W{\"a}hrend in anderen Arbeiten in der Literatur vor allem Umgebungen untersucht worden sind, in welchen die mentalen Zust{\"a}nde der Agenten eindeutig bestimmbar sind, z.B. in Spielen mit asymmetrischen Informationen, untersuchen wir Theory of Mind in einer kollaborativen Multi-Agenten-Umgebung, in welcher solche mentalen Zust{\"a}nde nicht durch die Umgebung bestimmt sind, n{\"a}mlich Overcooked. Um dennoch die mentalen Zust{\"a}nde anderer Agenten vorhersagen zu k{\"o}nnen, schlagen wir drei Auxiliary-Tasks vor, welche wiederum von Theory of Mind inspiriert sind: Vorhersage (i) der n{\"a}chsten Aktion des Partners, (ii) des n{\"a}chsten strategischen Ziels des Partners und (iii) des neuronalen Zustands des Partners. Unsere Arbeit zeigt, dass Self-Play-Agenten, die mit diesen Auxiliary-Tasks trainiert wurden, zwar eine bessere Spielkompetenz aufweisen, aber bei der Kooperation mit Unbekannten unterdurchschnittlich abschneiden.

We address these problems by selecting cooking as our domain. Our proposed cooking support system, MimiCook, embodies a recipe in a real kitchen counter and directly navigates a user. The system consists of a computer, a depth camera, a projector, and a scaling device. It displays step-by-step instructions directly onto the utensils and ingredients, and controls the guidance display in accordance with the user's situations. The integrated scaling device also helps users to avoid mistakes with measuring units. Results of our user study shows participants found it easier to cook with the system and even subjects who had never cooked the assigned recipe did not make any mistakes.},

This challenging problem requires to consider the entire set of satisfiable scenarios of a QCN, whose size is usually exponential in the number of constraints of that QCN; however, we present a first algorithm that is able to compute a robust scenario of a QCN using linear space in the number of constraints. Preliminary results with a dataset from the job-shop scheduling domain, and a standard one, show the interest of our approach and highlight the fact that not all solutions are created equal.},

The language supports both generative and HTN planning models in a uniform framework and has a clear, well-defined semantics. Despite the richness of the language, it is possible to translate it into PDDL, with some increase in the number and complexity of operators and conditions. In this paper, we describe the central and unique features of the ANML language and sketch key parts of the translation to PDDL.},

Hybrid planning is a strategy for treating them jointly. However, by incorporating all these aspects into a hybrid planner, its search space is huge by construction. This paper introduces the planner CHIMP, which is based on meta-CSP planning to represent the hybrid plan space and uses hierarchical planning as the strategy for cutting efficiently through this space. The paper makes two contributions: First, it describes how HTN planning is integrated into meta-CSP reasoning leading to a planner that can reason about different forms of knowledge and that is fast enough to be used on a robot. Second, it demonstrates CHIMP's task merging capabilities, i.e., the unification of different tasks from different plan parts, resulting in plans that are more efficient to execute. It also allows to merge new tasks online into a plan that is being executed. This is demonstrated on a PR2 robot.},

The key challenge in this context is to allow the design of fleet control systems that, on the one hand, allow flexible and reactive operation of individual robots and, on the other hand, enable the system to optimize the global behavior of the fleet in order to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. To approach this problem, we propose to extend the Refinement Acting Engine (RAE) that has been used to program the behavior of autonomous agents through a hierarchical decomposition of high-level tasks into primitive commands, and is the subject of active research in order to guide its decisions with planning and scheduling techniques. The core of our proposal is to provide first-hand support for concurrency in the RAE procedure, allowing a natural representation for concurrent systems by reasoning on resource allocation. The resulting acting engine exploits a custom language that is designed to ease its integration with planning engines, both through its simple and orthogonal core constructs as well as in the explicit identification of decision points in the system operation. We provide an initial validation of the system in simulation on a logistic problem involving a fleet of robots.},

In particular, experiments were performed against themselves and a human model for the planning methods, and an improved coupled planning algorithm, in which the failures are handled by deviating from optimal play, under different game steps. And a study on collision failures is performed. The results concluded that extrapolation of results are sub-optimal and that collision failures can be significantly reduced by handling collision differently; walking into the opposite direction.},

In qualitative constraint-based reasoning, the state-of-the-art approach to tackle a given \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$consists in employing a backtracking algorithm, where the branching decisions during search and the refinement of the \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$are governed by certain heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. Although there has been plenty of research on how these heuristics compare and behave in terms of checking the satisfiability of a \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$fast, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any study on how they compare and behave in terms of obtaining a tractable refinement of a \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$that is also robust. In brief, a robust refinement of a \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$can be primarily seen as one that retains as many qualitative solutions as possible, e.g., the configuration ``Task~A is scheduled after or during Task~C'' is more robust than ``Task~A is scheduled after Task~C''. Here, we make such a preliminary comparison and evaluation with respect to prominent heuristics in the literature, and reveal that there exists a trade-off between fast and robust solving of \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{QCN\}\$\$s for datasets consisting of instances of Allen's Interval Algebra and Region Connection Calculus. Furthermore, we investigate reasons for the existence of this trade-off and find that more aggressive heuristics are more efficient at the cost of producing less robust refinements.},
