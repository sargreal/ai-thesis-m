\cite{bit-monnotTemporalHierarchicalModels2017} argues that qualitative time points in this context have the only benefit of creating instantaneous action effects, which are not necessary in most environments.

FAPE claims several times to do Acting, but it is not implemented.
Missing features included: 
HTN Repair/Replanning (only classical planning was considered before it was removed from the code). 
Removal of actions and tasks from a plan.
The use of STNUs for contingent time points - technically implemented, but not documented how to use them.
The insertion of timelines in between an existing timeline is not supported.


It has to be mentioned that Fape is not the most performant HTN planner, but besides CHIMP the only one supporting all required features.
