First of all, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Diedrich Wolter, my professor, for the opportunity to work on this topic for my thesis. He helped me with the brainstorming of possible approaches and referred me to different topics of interest.

Further thanks go to my fellow students, friends, and family for the ongoing support during the time of writing and coding. Special thanks to Tobias Schwartz and Sonja Ruschhaupt for proofreading and feedback on the thesis.
