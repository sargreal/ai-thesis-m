Firstly, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Diedrich Wolter, my professor, for the opportunity to work on this topic for my thesis. He helped me with the brainstorming of possible approaches and referred me to different topics of interest.

Second of all, I want to thank Tobias Schwartz, my supervisor, for the incredible support while working on this thesis. He helped me in often weekly sessions and provided feedback and counsel.

Further thanks go to my fellow students, friends, and family for the ongoing support during the time of writing and coding. Special thanks to Sonja Ruschhaupt for proofreading and feedback on the thesis.
