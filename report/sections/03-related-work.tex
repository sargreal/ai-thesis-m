\section{Related Work}

There has already been some research in this game that focused on Classical Planning \citep{yuxinliuPlanningOvercookedGame2020}, Human-Robot Interaction \citep{bishopCHAOPTTestbedEvaluating2020,roseroTwoManyCooks2021,ruhdorferMindsChefsUsing2023} and Reinforcement Learning using the Theory of Mind \citep{ruhdorferMindsChefsUsing2023}.
\cite{bishopCHAOPTTestbedEvaluating2020,roseroTwoManyCooks2021} do not use actual AI techniques, but the Wizard of Oz paradigm where the AI Agent is simulated by a human but the participants are unaware of that.
The major component of asynchronous receiving of orders has not been considered techniqually in the mentioned research.

Support for Temporal HTN Planning has ben implemented in the two major works CHIMP \citep{stockHierarchicalHybridPlanning2017} and FAPE \citep{bit-monnotFAPEConstraintbasedPlanner2020}.
CHIMP uses a custom domain definition language based on the SHOP2 language, while FAPE a extended version the Language ANML.
There is a proposal for HDDL2.1 \citep{pellierHDDLDefiningFormalism2023} that adds support for the durative actions and time constraints from PDDL2.1 \citep{foxPDDL2ExtensionPDDL2003} to the HDDL language \citep{hollerHDDLExtensionPDDL2020}, a hierachical version of PDDL.
HDDL2.1 is however not supported by any planner yet.
The planning system most likely implementing the necessary features in the future is Aries \citep{bit-monnotAries2024}, however that is still in active development.
An interesting project in this context is the Unified-Planning System \citep{frambaUnifiedPlanning2024} by the AIPlan4EU H2020 Project\footnote{https://aiplan4eu-project.eu}, that aims at providing a common python api for calling and interacting with any planner.

Acting has been researched in several ways especially in the Refinement Acting Engine \citep{ghallabAutomatedPlanningActing2016,more} as well as in HTN planning \citep{bit-monnotTemporalHierarchicalModels2017,desilvaHTNActingFormalism2018,patraIntegratingActingPlanning2020,bansodIntegratingPlanningActing2021}.
Repair and Replanning \citep{bansodHTNReplanningMiddle2022} is also actively researched.
