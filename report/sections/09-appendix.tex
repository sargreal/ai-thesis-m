If you have received this thesis in printed form, you will find a CD with supplementary material at the end.
If you have received this thesis in a digital form, you can access the supplementary material in the git repositories \href{https://github.com/sargreal/fape}{github.com/sargreal/fape} (changes to \ac{FAPE}) and \href{https://github.com/sargreal/ai-thesis-m}{github.com/sargreal/ai-thesis-m} (thesis, problem files and evaluation).

The contents of the CD are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item thesis: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item problem: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item anml: anml problem files.
      \item hddl: initial implementation of the \textit{Overcooked} domain in HDDL2.1
    \end{itemize}
    \item report: contains all latex files and figures used to write this thesis
    \item evaluation: evaluation files in csv format and an jupyter notebook that was used for calculating mean and standard deviations
    \item scripts: several scripts that were used to automate tasks such as planning, acting and visualization of solutions
    \item solutions: several raw solutions and visualizations to the planning and acting problems
    \item fape-planning-assembly-1.0.jar: the exact version of fape that was used for the evaluations
  \end{itemize}
  \item fape: our adapted version of fape including \verb|changes.diff| that is a git diff file describing all changes we made to the planner
\end{itemize}
